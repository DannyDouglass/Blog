Below I have provided a variety of material/links from my presentation last night - “**The Current State of Package Management in .NET**”.  Please feel free to contact me using any of the communication channels available in the right column of my blog.  I would happy to provide any further information regarding **Nu** or **OpenWrap**, or just to discuss your thoughts on the topic of package management.

I want to thank everyone that battled the weather last night to make it to the presentation.  I really enjoyed my first opportunity to present at an ALT.NET event.  Also, thanks to [Matthew Podwysocki](http://weblogs.asp.net/Podwysocki/) for allowing me to speak last night.  I believe I’ve included everything below that I discussed last night. If you take time to review the slideshow, I’d recommended using one of the two links below the embedded slideshow as they contain the speaker notes with a lot of information.

### Gem Creation Example

I showed how to use Nu to download and install packages, as well as how to actually create a Ruby gem that can be utilized with Nu.  Below are the links to the PagedList project before refactoring for gem creation and after I modified the project.
