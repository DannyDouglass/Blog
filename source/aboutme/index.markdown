[My Resume](/downloads/DanielDouglass_Resume.pdf)

You may have figured out by now that my name is Danny Douglass and I am a big fan of technology. As far as software development is concerned, Microsoft ASP.Net development tends to be my bread and butter, but my development interests go far beyond .Net. I make a dedicated effort to stay apprised of the latest and greatest, and I welcome the opportunity to try those new technology. Some might say that I'm a bit of an Apple fanboy...so far I've guilty of dishing out my hard earned greenbacks for a MacBook Air, iPod Nano, (2) iPod Shuffles, a MacBook Pro, an iPhone 3GS and 4S, and (2) iPads - which I use to read up on all the latest [publications](/bookshelf).

Currently I live in Alexandria, VA a few miles outside of Washington, DC. I'll get in trouble if I fail to mention my wonderful wife - Kaitlyn Douglass who patiently deals with obsession for technology. I have two awesome dogs, Bauer (named after the one and only Jack Bauer) and Lilly. I really consider myself lucky to have such an incredible, supportive family and a crazy awesome group of friends.

Sports are a huge part of my life, both as a fan and player. I play hockey several times a week in the [DC Street Hockey](http://DCStreetHockey.com) leagues...a site that I built from scratch using ASP.Net MVC 1, jQuery, SubSonic 3, and a variety of other tools. I continue to maintain the site and highly recommend the league if you are interested in playing hockey in the DC area.
