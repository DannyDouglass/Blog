You may have figured out by now that my name is Danny Douglass and I am a big fan of technology. As far as software development is concerned, Microsoft ASP.Net development tends to be my bread and butter, but my development interests go far beyond .Net. I make a dedicated effort to stay apprised of the latest and greatest, and I welcome the opportunity to try those new technology. Some might say that I'm a bit of an Apple fanboy...so far I've guilty of dishing out my hard earned greenbacks for a MacBook Air, iPod Nano, (2) iPod Shuffles, a MacBook Pro, an iPhone 3GS and 4S, and (2) iPads - which I use to read up on all the latest [publications](/bookshelf).

Currently I live in Alexandria, VA a few miles outside of Washington, DC. I'll get in trouble if I fail to mention my wonderful wife - Kaitlyn Douglass who patiently deals with obsession for technology. I have two awesome dogs, Bauer (named after the one and only Jack Bauer) and Lilly. I really consider myself lucky to have such an incredible, supportive family and a crazy awesome group of friends.

Sports are a huge part of my life, both as a fan and player. I play hockey several times a week in the [DCStreetHockey](http://DCStreetHockey.com) leagues...a site that I built from scratch using ASP.Net MVC 1, jQuery, SubSonic 3, and a variety of other tools. I continue to maintain the site and highly recommend the league if you are interested in playing hockey in the DC area.

My most frequently used social networking sites are found in the right column. Feel free to contact me at any of those mediums or at my personal email: [DDouglass (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:DDouglass@gmail.com) (no link exchanges please).
