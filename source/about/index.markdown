You may have figured out by now that my name is Danny Douglass and I am a big fan of technology.  I am passionate about the latest and greatest technologies/trends, leadership, and business stories of both successes and failures of all kinds.  I find a lot of value and motiviation from reading great [publications](/bookshelf) - check them out for recommendations. Some of my most influential areas currently are Lean Startup, JavaScript, and Continuous Delivery.  In fact, I am both a co-organizer and speaker at the following meetup groups:

- [DC Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment Group](http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/)  
- [DC ALT.NET](http://www.meetup.com/dcaltnet/)  

Currently I live in Arlington, VA a few miles outside of Washington, DC. My awesome dog Bauer (named after the one and only Jack Bauer) is pictured above. I really consider myself lucky to have such an incredible, supportive family and a crazy awesome group of friends.

Sports are a huge part of my life, both as a fan and player. I play hockey several times a week in the [DC Street Hockey](http://DCStreetHockey.com) leagues...a site that I built from scratch using ASP.Net MVC 1, jQuery, SubSonic 3, and a variety of other tools way back in 2008. I continue to maintain the site and highly recommend the league if you are interested in playing hockey in the DC area.

My most frequently used social networking sites are found above. Feel free to contact me at any of those mediums or at my personal email: [DDouglass (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:DDouglass@gmail.com) (no link exchanges please).
